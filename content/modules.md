## Let's start our first application

... by creating our first module

Note: These notes work!!!


## wait, what's a module?

Containers for different parts of your application. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Except those containers can use other containers.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Places where we will write pieces of our application and define dependencies <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Note: Mention modular design


## wait, what's a module?

- Maintainable and testable <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Readable <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
